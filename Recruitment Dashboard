Recruitment Analytics Dashboard – End-to-End Case Study
Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end Recruitment Analytics case study designed to analyze hiring performance across the complete talent acquisition lifecycle. The objective is to transform recruitment data into actionable insights using interactive dashboards.

The project is divided into three interconnected dashboards, each answering a different business question.

Dashboards Included
1. Overview Dashboard

Provides a high-level snapshot of recruitment performance, including:

Total openings, applications, shortlists, offers, and hires

Funnel conversion rates and offer acceptance

Average time to fill and cost per hire

Focus: Identifying overall hiring efficiency and major drop-offs in the recruitment funnel.

2. Hiring Efficiency Dashboard

Analyzes how efficiently hiring is executed across sources, recruiters, and experience levels:

Source effectiveness by experience level

Recruiter-wise performance and drop-offs

Role-wise cost and time-to-fill comparison

Focus: Understanding where hiring slows down and which channels perform best.

3. Hiring Details Dashboard

Deep-dives into granular hiring metrics:

Department-wise and role-wise hiring cost

Month-on-month hiring trends and volatility

Interview-to-offer and offer-to-hire conversions

Focus: Identifying cost drivers, planning gaps, and funnel inefficiencies.

Key Insights

High application volumes do not always translate into high hires

Senior-level roles significantly increase cost and time to hire

Hiring performance varies widely by source, recruiter, and role

Reactive hiring patterns lead to volatility in monthly outcomes
