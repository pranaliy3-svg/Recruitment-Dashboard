Recruitment Analytics Dashboard – End-to-End Case Study
Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end Recruitment Analytics case study designed to analyze hiring performance across the complete talent acquisition lifecycle. The objective is to transform recruitment data into actionable insights using interactive dashboards.

The project is divided into three interconnected dashboards, each answering a different business question.


Recruitment Dashboard – Key Insights (Overview)

This dashboard gives a high-level view of the hiring funnel and where efficiency can be improved.

🔹 Hiring Funnel Snapshot

75 total openings attracted ~24K applications

Only ~17K moved to shortlist, resulting in 152 offers

60 hires were finally onboarded
➡️ Indicates a high volume → low conversion funnel, suggesting scope for better screening and alignment.

🔹 Department-wise Demand

IT has the highest openings, followed by Analytics, Finance, and Sales
➡️ Tech and data roles continue to drive hiring demand.

🔹 Time & Cost Efficiency

Average time to fill: 33 days

Cost per hire: ~68K
➡️ These metrics highlight opportunities to optimize sourcing and hiring speed.

🔹 Drop-offs & Rejections

Major drop-offs are driven by personal reasons, better offers, salary issues, and role mismatch
➡️ Points towards compensation alignment and expectation-setting gaps early in the process.

🔹 Hiring Manager Impact

Certain hiring managers show higher candidate drop-offs
➡️ Indicates the need for standardized interview processes and interviewer calibration.

🔹 Source Effectiveness

LinkedIn is the top application source, followed by referrals and consultants
➡️ Digital sourcing channels are outperforming traditional ones.

📌 Overall Insight:
This dashboard highlights where candidates enter, exit, and convert in the recruitment pipeline — setting the foundation for deeper analysis into hiring efficiency and quality.


📊 Recruitment Dashboard – Hiring Efficiency Insights

This dashboard focuses on how efficiently hiring happens across sources, recruiters, roles, and experience levels.

🔹 Source vs Experience Level

LinkedIn and Consultants contribute most hires across senior and mid-level roles

Campus hiring is mainly effective for entry-level positions
➡️ Indicates sourcing channels should be aligned with role seniority, not used uniformly.

🔹 Recruiter-wise Performance

Recruiters vary significantly in drop-offs, hires, and time to fill

Some recruiters close roles faster with fewer drop-offs, while others show delays
➡️ Highlights the need for recruiter benchmarking and best-practice sharing.

🔹 Department & Source Effectiveness

IT and Finance hiring relies heavily on LinkedIn and Consultants

Referrals and Campus hiring show selective but efficient contributions
➡️ Department-wise sourcing strategy can improve cost and speed.

🔹 Cost & Time by Role

Certain roles show higher cost per hire with longer time to fill

Specialized and senior roles take the longest to close
➡️ Suggests early workforce planning and proactive sourcing for niche roles.

📌 Overall Insight:
This dashboard helps identify where hiring is efficient, where it slows down, and why — enabling smarter allocation of recruiters, sourcing channels, and budgets.


📊 Recruitment Dashboard – Hiring Details & Funnel Insights

This dashboard deep-dives into cost, experience level, time trends, and role-wise funnel performance.

🔹 Experience Level vs Cost to Hire

Senior-level hires have the highest cost across departments

Entry and mid-level roles show relatively controlled hiring costs
➡️ Highlights the need for early planning and proactive sourcing for senior roles to manage cost.

🔹 Department-wise Hiring Mix

IT, Finance, and Sales dominate hiring across experience levels

Some departments show fewer hires but significantly higher cost
➡️ Suggests uneven hiring efficiency across functions.

🔹 Month-on-Month Hiring Volatility

Openings, shortlisting, and hiring percentages fluctuate sharply month to month

Sudden spikes and drops indicate reactive hiring patterns
➡️ Points to scope for better workforce forecasting and demand planning.

🔹 Role-wise Funnel Conversion

High application volumes do not always translate into hires

Certain roles have large drop-offs between interviews and offers
➡️ Indicates misalignment between job requirements, candidate expectations, or interview calibration.

🔹 Hiring Trend Over Time

Hiring numbers vary significantly across months
➡️ Reinforces the need to smooth hiring cycles and reduce last-minute pressure.



🔹 Dashboard 1: Overview
High application volume with low hire conversion highlights gaps in early screening, expectation alignment, and offer acceptance.

🔹 Dashboard 2: Hiring Efficiency
Different sourcing channels perform better at different experience levels. Recruiter-wise and role-wise variations show where hiring slows down or becomes expensive.

🔹 Dashboard 3: Hiring Details
Senior roles drive higher cost and time to fill. Month-on-month volatility and role-level funnel drop-offs point toward reactive hiring and planning gaps.

📌 Key Learning:
Recruitment data is most powerful when viewed end-to-end — not in silos. Insights emerge when volume, cost, time, and conversion are analyzed together.
